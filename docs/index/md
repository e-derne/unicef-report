GLOBAL POST-PANDEMIC REALITY : HEALTH SYSTEMS STILL LACK SANITATION

Building resilience from the inside out: WASH in health-care systems

2 BILLION PEOPLE
rely on healthcare facilities that lack basic water services

Meaning that 
- Spread of preventable diseases and heightened risk of infection
- Increased maternal and newborn mortality
- Lower life expectancy at birth

COVID-19 was a wake-up call.
The pandemic put the spotlight back on health care importance and exposed how fragile even the strongest health systems can be. Around the world, underinvestment and poor infrastructure pushed hospitals to their limits.
But funding is only part of the story.


1. Top 12 countries – Facilities without sanitation

**Key finding:**  
Here are the 12 countries where up to 40 % of health-care centres lack basic WASH services, making care unsafe for mothers, newborns and the elderly.

> These findings highlight the urgent need for investment in WASH infrastructure in health-care systems, especially in “burning zones” across Africa and South-East Asia.

## 2. Sanitation vs. Life Expectancy

**What’s at stake?**  
Life expectancy is one of the most telling indicators of overall well-being. This scatter clearly shows that poor sanitation in health-care facilities correlates with significantly lower life-expectancy rates.

> Behind the numbers, real lives are at stake: maternal and infant mortality, poor disease control, and limited access to quality care all feed into this systemic crisis.

> In 2021, Australia allocates 19.3 % of its GDP to health expenditure.

## 5. Next Steps — Building resilience from the inside out

1. **Long-term partnerships**  
   NGOs & local governments must co-design sustainable WASH infrastructures, train local health workers, and ensure knowledge transfer.  
2. **Empowerment over dependence**  
   Move from charity to capacity-building: investing in resilient health systems is investing in human dignity, global stability and future pandemic prevention.
